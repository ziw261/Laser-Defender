  storyText2:
  - 'Long, long ago, the universe was ruled by two major races. One of them was human.
    They built the empire called A, and governed two-thirds of the universe. The remaining
    third belonged to a race called the Duoragong. Duoragong people were famous for
    their intelligence and longevity. They were peaceful at heart. Humans were always
    jealous of these characteristics.


'
  - "The two big races were always at peace. Every 500 star-years they would go to
    each other\u2019s realm in turn to renew the friendship policy. The peace was
    never broken, until a tyrant, S, started leading empire A."
  - "Your name is Icehorg. You are the son of the leader of Duoragong. It\u2019s the
    star-year 1551, and you are going with your father and your sister--under the
    protection of your guardians--to empire A, to renew the friendship policy.\n"
  - 'After walking into the hall where the meeting is held, you felt that something
    was wrong. There were more empire soldiers than usual, and they all had serious
    faces. When you tried to remind your father of the situation, the soldiers raised
    their guns against your people. Seeing this situation, your guardians also raised
    their guns against the empire soldiers. A war was about to start.

'
  - "The new tyrant, S, came into the hall: \u201CYou idiots are too young, too simple.
    How dare you come to my empire with just these few guardians. I don\u2019t understand
    why my previous emperors dared not to destroy you guys. But today I\u2019ll crush
    you, and tomorrow the whole universe will be mine.\u201D\n"
  - "S turned away and waved his hand: \u201CKill them all.\u201D\n"
  - 'When your father tried to lead the guardians to take the initiative, a shot and
    a wail came from behind you. The human soldiers were smiling ironically as you
    slowly turned around, and saw that half of your guardians were pointing their
    weapons at you.

'
  - 'Right away, the captain of guardians jumped up from the ground and killed the
    betrayers. He asked the rest of guardians to protect your father, your sister,
    and you, and to evacuate as soon as possible. Then, he faced the entire empire
    army all by himself.

'
  - Under the protection of your guardians and their sacrifices, you managed to get
    super close to the gate. When you were about to get out of the hall and escape,
    another party of soldiers came from that direction. Your little sister grabbed
    your clothes tightly, and you became hopeless and despairing.
  - " At that moment, your father told you in Duoragonese: \u201CI\u2019m going to
    use a bomb that is still under examination. This is a replica, so the power is
    not that much, but it\u2019s enough to earn time for you to take your sister and
    commandeer our aircraft to flee. The real bomb is stored in our underground laboratory.
    If the war is to begin, you must think carefully about how to use it. Now, go
    to our plane and take your sister back to our planet. Go!\u201D\n"
  - "While saying these words, your father activated the running booster attached
    to your legs and pushed you, hard. As one of the top pilots of the Duoragong,
    you knew you didn\u2019t have much time to choose. Any hesitation would be wasting
    the opportunity your father made. "
  - 'You grabbed your sister, who was crying and trying to run to your father, and
    rushed to the aircraft. After boarding the aircraft, you activated the shield
    system to protect you and your sister from the explosion. With the giant explosion,
    your plane flew into space. Tears fell from your eyes, but they turned out to
    be the fuel of your resolution of revenge.

'
  - 'However, you were not safe. A lot of enemy planes took off and tried to shoot
    you down  '
